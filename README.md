# FAIRification_workflow
Mapping existing FAIRification workflows, describing roles, tools and insights per steps.

There are several FAIRification workflows out there. We wanted to paint the landscape of FAIRification steps, identify the steps that are common and others that are specific per domain (e.g. rare disease wokrflow consider adding their metadata to the EU rd metadata repository a step), map the roles needed to achieve each step (e.g. step x needs an ontologist / biosemantic expert), which tools are being used in each step (e.g. literature describes that people go to certain ontology portals to find ontologies to map their variables to).

Draft report for how the standard steps will be shared https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bU4cAAABRRP4yvRqNGPMP0rs3vzjg04A9Sphipy1WWI/edit?usp=sharing
